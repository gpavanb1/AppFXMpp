# AppFXM++

This repository contains the boilerplate code for creating an application using SplitFXM++

## What does 'split' mean?
The user is directed to [SplitFXM](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gpavanb1/SplitFXM/refs/heads/main/README.md) README for further details and documentation

## How to install and execute?

This can be most easily used with VSCode. There is a `tasks.json` that contains the build and run commands that can be invoked directly from the IDE.

The driver program is in `main.cpp` which can be compiled and executed

Note that you would need to install in the `third-party` directory
